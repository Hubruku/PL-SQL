# Integrity constraints & packages

This project is based on M:N relation between patient and doctor. First IO wont let the same patient visit the same doctor more than two times a day. Second "IO" is realised by package. It is supposed to move patients from one doctor, to another, using all the functions & procedures in the package ( associative table of doctor and patient has wrong name, it should be named registration instead of examination ).
