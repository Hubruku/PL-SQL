# Recursion

This project is supposed to print lineage of otters ( DDL & schema is assignment from college ). Basicly you choose ID of the otter you wish to print parents for, and then if you want to print mother or fathers from its lineage. There are SQL scripts for basic recursion, then there is procedure that handles inputs, and lastly there is test, to see if everything works. Logs included aswell.
